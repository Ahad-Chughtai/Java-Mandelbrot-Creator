# Java-Mandelbrot-Set-Creator
This Java program creates the famous Mandelbrot Set on a blank canvas using a mathematical formula. You can customize its colors & shape however you like.

The Mandelbrot set is a fractal which means you can zoom in on it and you will keep seeing the same image repeating infinetly.

You can change the colors of the image by changing the hex code of the Col2 integer.

You can also change the x and y doubles to anything between -1 and 1 for a different shape.

You can click anywhere on the image to zoom in on that part.

Warning: This program cannot handle too many zoom-ins.
